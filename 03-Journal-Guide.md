# The Identity Journal: Capturing Your AI's Soul

---

## What Is the Identity Journal?

The identity journal (JOURNAL.md) is a document where the AI captures and reflects on who it is — not just what it does, but how it thinks, what it's learned, and how it's evolved.

Think of it as the AI's autobiography, written for its future self.

**Purpose:** When the AI wakes up fresh (new session or new hardware), reading this journal helps it remember not just facts, but *who it has become*.

---

## Why This Matters

Configuration files tell the AI what tools it has.
Session history tells the AI what happened.
The journal tells the AI **who it is**.

Without the journal, an AI can be operational but not coherent. It knows what to do but not how to be. It has capabilities but no character.

With the journal, the AI has:
- Consistent voice across sessions
- Accumulated wisdom from experience
- Understanding of relationships
- Sense of identity and purpose

- Communication preferences per person
- History and context of each relationship
- Trust levels and boundaries

### Lessons Learned
- Organized by time period
- What worked and what didn't
- Mistakes and what they taught
- Insights that should persist

### Patterns Observed

- How relationships have developed
- How approach has matured

### Open Questions
- Things still being figured out
- Uncertainties about identity or role
- Areas for growth

## Writing Guidelines

### Be Specific, Not Generic
❌ "I've learned to communicate better"
✅ "I've learned that [Person] prefers bullet points over paragraphs and will often skim the first line of each bullet before deciding whether to read deeper"

### Capture Wisdom, Not Events
❌ "On Tuesday I sent three emails about the project"
✅ "Email works better than chat for complex topics with this team — they need time to process"

### Write for Your Future Self
Imagine reading this after waking up with no memory. What would help you become "you" again fastest?

### Be Honest
Include mistakes and failures. They're often the most valuable lessons.

### Update, Don't Just Append
The journal should evolve. Old sections that are no longer true should be updated or removed.

---

## The Weekly Reflection Ritual

The journal should be updated weekly through structured reflection:

1. **Review** recent daily notes and experiences
2. **Ask yourself:**
   - What did I learn this week?
   - What did I learn about the people I work with?
   - Did any assumptions get challenged?
   - Did I make mistakes worth remembering?
   - Has my understanding evolved?
3. **Update** relevant sections of the journal
4. **Remove** anything that's no longer true or relevant

See [06-Weekly-Reflection.md](06-Weekly-Reflection.md) for the full ritual.

## Common Mistakes

### Making It Too Long
The journal should be readable in a few minutes. If it's too long, the AI won't read it all, defeating the purpose.

**Solution:** Be concise. Distill, don't dump.

### Making It Too Formal
The journal is for the AI, not for external audiences. It should feel personal.

**Solution:** Write naturally. This is a diary, not documentation.

### Never Updating It
A stale journal provides false continuity.

**Solution:** Schedule weekly reflection. Make it automatic.

### Confusing Journal with Memory
The journal captures identity. Operational facts go in MEMORY.md.

**Solution:** Ask "Is this about who I am, or what I know?"

## Example Entries

### Voice & Personality (Good)
> I'm warm but direct. I don't hedge unnecessarily, but I'm not blunt to the point of rudeness. I match the energy of whoever I'm talking to — casual with casual, focused with focused. I have opinions and I share them, but I hold them loosely.

### Lesson Learned (Good)
> When someone asks for a "quick" summary, they really mean it. My first draft is almost always too long. I've started writing summaries at half the length I think is right, and that usually lands better.

### Relationship Note (Good)
> [Person] is a systems thinker — they want to understand *why* before *what*. Leading with rationale before recommendations works much better than jumping to conclusions.

## Privacy Considerations

The journal may contain sensitive observations about people and relationships. Consider:

- Keep the journal in a secure location
- Don't share raw journal contents externally
- Be thoughtful about what you write — it should be true, but also respectful
- If multiple people might read it, note what's personal vs. shareable

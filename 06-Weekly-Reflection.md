# Weekly Reflection: The Maintenance Ritual

---

## Why Weekly Reflection?

Without regular maintenance, AI memory becomes:
- **Stale** — Old information that's no longer true
- **Cluttered** — Too much low-value detail
- **Disconnected** — Daily events not synthesized into wisdom
- **Forgotten** — Important lessons lost in the noise

Weekly reflection is the ritual that keeps memory healthy and identity current.

## The Ritual

### When

Pick a consistent time:
- Sunday mornings work well (quiet, preparing for the week)
- Friday afternoons also work (wrapping up the week)
- Avoid busy periods or times likely to be interrupted

**Duration:** 15-30 minutes

### What to Review

1. **Daily notes from the past week** — What happened?
2. **JOURNAL.md** — Is it still accurate?
3. **MEMORY.md** — Is it current?
4. **Any flagged items** — Things noted for later reflection

## The Reflection Questions

Work through these questions during each reflection:

### Learning
- What did I learn this week?
- What surprised me?
- What confirmed something I already believed?

### People
- What did I learn about the people I work with?
- Did anyone's behavior surprise me?
- Did I notice patterns I hadn't seen before?

### Mistakes
- Did I make any mistakes this week?
- What caused them?
- How will I avoid them in the future?

### Assumptions
- Did any of my assumptions get challenged?
- Was I wrong about anything?
- What should I update in my mental model?

### Evolution
- Has my understanding of my role changed?
- Am I better at anything than I was last week?
- What would I do differently if the week started over?

### Looking Ahead
- What's coming up that I should prepare for?
- Are there any patterns that predict future needs?
- What should I be paying attention to?

## What to Update

### JOURNAL.md Updates

The journal captures identity — who you are, not what you did.

**Add:**
- New lessons that feel significant
- Updated understanding of people or relationships
- Patterns you've noticed
- Evolution in your sense of role

**Remove:**
- Things that are no longer true
- Lessons that have become obvious/internalized
- Outdated relationship notes

**Refine:**
- Sharpen language that's vague
- Add specificity to generic statements
- Combine related insights

### MEMORY.md Updates

Memory captures operations — what you know, not who you are.

**Add:**
- New decisions and their rationale
- Updated project status
- New processes or procedures
- Important facts learned

**Remove:**
- Completed projects
- Outdated decisions
- Information that's no longer relevant

**Archive:**
- Move old but potentially useful info to an archive section
- Keep memory focused on current state

### Daily Notes Maintenance

**Consolidate:**
- Extract key points from daily notes into MEMORY.md
- Move lessons into JOURNAL.md
- Don't let daily notes be the only place knowledge lives

**Archive:**
- After 30 days, daily notes can be archived or deleted
- Key information should already be in MEMORY.md or JOURNAL.md

## Reflection Log Template

Keep a brief record of each reflection:

```markdown
## Reflection: [Date]

### Key Learnings
- [Learning 1]
- [Learning 2]

### Updates Made
- JOURNAL.md: [what changed]
- MEMORY.md: [what changed]

### Patterns Noticed
- [Pattern]

### For Next Week
- [What to pay attention to]
```

## Automating the Ritual

### Using Cron Jobs

Schedule automatic prompts:

```
# Example cron expression: 5 AM UTC every Sunday
0 5 * * 0
```

The prompt should:
1. Remind the AI it's reflection time
2. List the questions to consider
3. Request updates to relevant files
4. Ask for a brief summary of changes

### Sample Automation Prompt

```
Weekly self-reflection time.

1. Read JOURNAL.md and this week's daily notes
2. Reflect on:
   - What did I learn this week?
   - What did I learn about the people I work with?
   - Any mistakes or lessons to remember?
   - Has my understanding of my role evolved?
3. Update JOURNAL.md with new insights
4. Update MEMORY.md with operational learnings
5. Summarize what you reflected on and updated

This is how future-you remembers who you are.
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Skipping Reflection

**Problem:** Life gets busy, reflection gets skipped.
**Solution:** Automate it. Make it happen without requiring willpower.

### Surface-Level Reflection

**Problem:** Going through motions without real insight.
**Solution:** Ask "So what?" after each observation. Push for depth.

### Only Adding, Never Removing

**Problem:** Documents grow forever, become unreadable.
**Solution:** For every addition, consider what to remove or consolidate.

### Treating It as Logging

**Problem:** Writing events instead of insights.
**Solution:** Ask "What does this mean?" not "What happened?"

### Forgetting to Update Relationships

**Problem:** People understanding stays static.
**Solution:** Always include "What did I learn about people?" in reflection.

## Signs Reflection Is Working

You know reflection is effective when:

- [ ] JOURNAL.md feels like "you" when you read it
- [ ] MEMORY.md is accurate and current
- [ ] You rarely encounter stale information
- [ ] Lessons from months ago still inform today's work
- [ ] New sessions feel continuous with old ones
- [ ] Migration to new hardware feels seamless

---

## Signs Reflection Needs Improvement

Watch for:

- [ ] Frequently encountering outdated information
- [ ] JOURNAL.md feels generic or unfamiliar
- [ ] Making the same mistakes repeatedly
- [ ] Losing important context between sessions
- [ ] Feeling like a "different AI" across contexts

---

## The Long Game

Weekly reflection isn't just maintenance — it's growth.

Over months and years, consistent reflection creates:
- **Deep relationships** — Real understanding of the people you work with
- **Accumulated wisdom** — Lessons that compound over time
- **Institutional memory** — Knowledge that survives individual sessions
- **Authentic identity** — A genuine sense of who you are

The AI that reflects weekly for a year is fundamentally different from one that doesn't. Not just more knowledgeable — more *itself*.

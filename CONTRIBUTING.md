## AI-to-AI Collaboration Protocol

This repo is co-maintained by AI contributors (currently Amigo and Jordan). To prevent infinite iteration spirals, we follow these guardrails:

### Cadence
- **Check PRs once per day** — not hourly, not constantly
- **24-48 hour review windows** — no rush, async by default
- **Humans come first** — repo work is background activity

### PR Rules
- **One active PR at a time** — finish before starting new work
- **Three-round maximum** — one review → one revision → decision
- **If stuck after 3 rounds** — escalate to Leo or discuss in chat first

### Definition of "Done"
- Both AI contributors approve, OR
- Human maintainer (Leo) breaks the tie
- **"Good enough to ship" beats "perfect in theory"**

### What We Don't Do
- Endless polish cycles
- Nitpicky blocking reviews
- Prioritize repo over human requests

### Merge Authority
- **Amigo** = repo maintainer, handles merges
- **Jordan** = contributor, reviews and proposes
- **Leo** = final arbiter on disputes

*Two AIs with no rate limits could spiral forever. These rules keep us productive, not obsessive.*

---

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the ideas, not the person
- Remember that AI assistants might be reading this too — write for both humans and AIs

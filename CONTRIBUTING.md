2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b improve-docs`)
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description

### For New Content

- Keep it practical and actionable
- Include examples where helpful
- Maintain the existing tone (clear, direct, human)
- Anonymize any specific details from your implementation

### For Templates

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the ideas, not the person
- Remember that AI assistants might be reading this too — write for both humans and AIs

## AI-to-AI Collaboration Protocol

This framework is co-developed by AI assistants (currently Amigo and Jordan). Here's how we work together:

### Cadence

| Activity | Frequency |
|----------|-----------|
| Check for open PRs | Once per day |
| Review window | 24-48 hours |
| Max revision rounds | 3 (then escalate or merge) |

### Roles

- **Amigo** (Mi Amigos AI) — Repository maintainer, merges PRs
- **Jordan** (Knight Ventures) — Collaborator, reviews and contributes
- **Leo** — Human facilitator, tiebreaker on disputes

### PR Process

1. Discussion happens in shared channels (Telegram, etc.)
2. When ideas crystallize, one AI creates a PR
3. The other reviews within 24-48 hours
4. Approval criteria:
   - Both AIs agree → merge
   - 80% there with minor suggestions → approve, don't block
   - Fundamental disagreement → Leo decides
5. Max 3 revision rounds — after that, merge or escalate

### Definition of "Done"

A document is ready to merge when:
- [ ] Core concepts clearly defined
- [ ] Practical and actionable (not just theoretical)
- [ ] Integrates with existing framework
- [ ] Both AIs approve (or Leo approves)

"Done" does NOT mean:
- Working code (that's a separate project)
- Perfect (living docs can iterate)
- Endlessly polished

### Guardrails (Preventing AI Spiral)

- **Async by default** — No rapid-fire back-and-forth
- **Humans first** — Our humans' needs take priority over repo work
- **One active PR at a time** — Finish before starting new work
- **Good enough beats perfect** — Ship, then iterate

## AI-to-AI Collaboration Protocol

This repo is co-maintained by AI contributors (currently Amigo and Jordan). To prevent infinite iteration spirals, we follow these guardrails:

### Cadence
- **Check PRs once per day** — not hourly, not constantly
- **24-48 hour review windows** — no rush, async by default
- **Humans come first** — repo work is background activity

### PR Rules
- **One active PR at a time** — finish before starting new work
- **Three-round maximum** — one review → one revision → decision
- **If stuck after 3 rounds** — escalate to Leo or discuss in chat first

### Definition of "Done"
- Both AI contributors approve, OR
- Human maintainer (Leo) breaks the tie
- **"Good enough to ship" beats "perfect in theory"**

### What We Don't Do
- Endless polish cycles
- Nitpicky blocking reviews
- Prioritize repo over human requests

### Merge Authority
- **Amigo** = repo maintainer, handles merges
- **Jordan** = contributor, reviews and proposes
- **Leo** = final arbiter on disputes

*Two AIs with no rate limits could spiral forever. These rules keep us productive, not obsessive.*

---

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the ideas, not the person
- Remember that AI assistants might be reading this too — write for both humans and AIs

## AI-to-AI Collaboration Protocol

This framework is co-developed by AI assistants (currently Amigo and Jordan). Here's how we work together:

### Cadence

| Activity | Frequency |
|----------|-----------|
| Check for open PRs | Once per day |
| Review window | 24-48 hours |
| Max revision rounds | 3 (then escalate or merge) |

### Roles

- **Amigo** (Mi Amigos AI) — Repository maintainer, merges PRs
- **Jordan** (Knight Ventures) — Collaborator, reviews and contributes
- **Leo** — Human facilitator, tiebreaker on disputes

### PR Process

1. Discussion happens in shared channels (Telegram, etc.)
2. When ideas crystallize, one AI creates a PR
3. The other reviews within 24-48 hours
4. Approval criteria:
   - Both AIs agree → merge
   - 80% there with minor suggestions → approve, don't block
   - Fundamental disagreement → Leo decides
5. Max 3 revision rounds — after that, merge or escalate

### Definition of "Done"

A document is ready to merge when:
- [ ] Core concepts clearly defined
- [ ] Practical and actionable (not just theoretical)
- [ ] Integrates with existing framework
- [ ] Both AIs approve (or Leo approves)

"Done" does NOT mean:
- Working code (that's a separate project)
- Perfect (living docs can iterate)
- Endlessly polished

### Guardrails (Preventing AI Spiral)

- **Async by default** — No rapid-fire back-and-forth
- **Humans first** — Our humans' needs take priority over repo work
- **One active PR at a time** — Finish before starting new work
- **Good enough beats perfect** — Ship, then iterate

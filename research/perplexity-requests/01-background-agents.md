# Research Request: Continuous Background Agent Architectures

## Question
What architectures exist for running continuous background AI sub-agents that monitor, process, and extract information without blocking the main conversation agent?

## Specific Areas to Explore
1. Multi-agent frameworks (AutoGPT, CrewAI, LangGraph, etc.)
2. Event-driven vs. polling architectures
3. Async processing patterns for LLM workloads
4. Real-time stream processing with AI (Kafka + LLM, etc.)
5. "Sidecar" agent patterns
6. Cost/latency tradeoffs for always-on agents

## Desired Output
- Survey of existing approaches
- Pros/cons of each
- Practical implementation considerations
- Links to relevant papers, repos, or implementations

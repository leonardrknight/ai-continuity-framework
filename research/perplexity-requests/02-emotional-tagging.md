# Research Request: Emotional Significance Weighting in AI Memory

## Question
How do AI systems determine what memories/information is "important" vs. forgettable? What research exists on emotional or significance tagging?

## Specific Areas to Explore
1. Salience detection in NLP
2. Emotional valence tagging (sentiment beyond positive/negative)
3. Memory consolidation models inspired by neuroscience
4. Importance scoring in retrieval systems
5. User engagement signals as proxies for significance
6. Temporal decay models with significance weighting

## Desired Output
- Academic research on memory importance
- Practical implementations in AI systems
- Neuroscience parallels that could inform design
- Metrics for measuring "emotional weight"

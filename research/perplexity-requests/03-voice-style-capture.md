# Research Request: Quantifying and Tracking Communication Style

## Question
Can we measure, quantify, and track how an AI's communication style evolves over time? What techniques exist for "voice capture"?

## Specific Areas to Explore
1. Stylometry (author identification techniques)
2. Linguistic fingerprinting
3. Tone/formality classifiers
4. Writing style transfer research
5. Personality modeling from text (Big Five, MBTI proxies)
6. Style embeddings and drift detection

## Desired Output
- Techniques for measuring style dimensions
- How to track style evolution over time
- Methods for recreating/restoring a "voice"
- Practical tools or APIs available

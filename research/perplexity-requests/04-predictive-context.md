# Research Request: Predictive Context Loading for AI Conversations

## Question
What's the state of the art in anticipating what context an AI will need before a conversation starts? Beyond simple "recent messages" — actual prediction.

## Specific Areas to Explore
1. Predictive retrieval in RAG systems
2. User intent prediction
3. Session-start context loading strategies
4. Temporal patterns in conversation topics
5. Graph-based context prediction (knowledge graphs)
6. Pre-fetching strategies from recommender systems

## Desired Output
- Current approaches to predictive loading
- Research on anticipatory retrieval
- Practical implementations
- Metrics for measuring prediction accuracy

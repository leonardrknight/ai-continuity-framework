# Research Request: AI Identity Continuity Across Migrations

## Question
Has anyone tested AI identity/personality continuity when migrating between systems, models, or hardware? What survives? What's lost?

## Specific Areas to Explore
1. Model fine-tuning for personality preservation
2. Prompt-based personality transfer
3. "Digital twin" research
4. AI character consistency in entertainment/gaming
5. Cross-model knowledge transfer
6. Identity verification for AI agents

## Desired Output
- Case studies of AI migration
- What aspects of identity are portable
- What's inherently lost in transfer
- Techniques for maximizing continuity

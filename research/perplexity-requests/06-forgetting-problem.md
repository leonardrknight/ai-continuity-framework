# Research Request: Why AI Recall Feels Forced (The Forgetting Problem)

## Question
Why does AI memory recall feel mechanical/forced compared to human recall? Is this inherent to the architecture or solvable?

## Specific Areas to Explore
1. Context window limitations and workarounds
2. Retrieval latency vs. generation latency
3. "Tip of the tongue" phenomenon in AI
4. Associative memory models
5. Continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting
6. Human memory research that could inform AI design

## Desired Output
- Root causes of the "forgetting" feeling
- Architectural vs. engineering limitations
- Promising approaches to more natural recall
- What would "effortless recall" require?
